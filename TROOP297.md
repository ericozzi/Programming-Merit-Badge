The 2024 version of the BSA Programming Merit Badge requirements can be found here: https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/Merit_Badge_ReqandRes/2024_Updates/(24)_Programming_REQ.pdf

During our time on Merit Badge Saturday, we will be going over all the talking requirements (**#1b**, **#2**, **#3**, and **#4**). 

**Requirement #1a** states that you need to view the Personal Safety Awareness “Digital Safety” video (with your parent of guardian’s permission). Please discuss with your parent or guardian and with their permission, watch the video before Merit Badge Saturday. The video can be found here: https://www.scouting.org/training/youth/scouts-bsa/

**Requirement #5** of the programming merit badge requires that the Scout choose, modify and demonstrate three different programs, each in a different programming language. To complete these requirement, you will likely need access to a laptop or desktop computer. A mobile phone will NOT work.

**Requirement #6** states that you need to research three career opportunities. For one of these career opportunities, find out the education, training and experience required. 

You will be expected to work on requirements #5 and #6 outside of Merit Badge Saturday.
